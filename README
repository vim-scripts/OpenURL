Type :OpenURL to start the utility.
It will then search the current line for links, if only one link is found then this link is opened.
If several links are found; OpenURL will display a prompt like this one:

1: http://www.vim.org
2: www.youtube.com
3: mailto://jonasmo441@gmail.com
?> 

You then answer accordingly with a number.

The following kinds of urls are allowed:
protocol://domain.ext
protocol://www.domain.ext
protocol://www.subdomain.domain.ext
www.domain.ext
user@domain.ext

If an email address is found; mailto:// will be the assumed protocol.
If a www.___.___ link is found; http:// will be the assumed protocol.
                            
These protocols are used/found by OpenURL:
http(s)://
ftp(s)://
mailto://
